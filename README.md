# Example of how to use BingChat with ExpressJS

Example for the issue https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/bing-chat/issues/55

## Usage

```bash
npm install 
npm start #or npm run dev
```

Make sure you're using `node >= 18` so `fetch` is available.

## Usage

**You need access to Bing Chat OR a valid cookie from someone who has access**.

The cookie you need from Bing is the `_U` cookie (or just all of the cookies concatenated together; both will work).

## Testing (http-local)

**Variant:** [Creative, Precise, Balanced] (opcional)
